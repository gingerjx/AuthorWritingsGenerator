# Writing style of Generative AI

Project focuses on creating the dataset of a text generated by different LLMs that try to follow the writing style of specific authors. The next step is to prepare the analysis of the text in the dimensions of stylometry in order to find the original author of the text.

## Code structure

Before running the code install necessary packages executing the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Notebook `book_stats` explores the dataset of books from [Guthenberg](https://aclanthology.org/E14-3011/) dataset and selects 10 authors, which are analyzed.

Notebook `generator` contains the code to generate text for different models

Notebook `analysis` explores and presents the insights on the books and genereted texts (**work in progress**).

**Note: notebooks should be run in the corresponding to above order.*
